Also see the DSI workshop on OOP in R at [ROOPWorkshop](https://github.com/dsidavis/ROOPWorkshop).


The XML documents can be "run" in R with 
```
xmlSource("setIs.xml")
```
to run the R code they contain.

One can also convert them to HTML, LaTeX, PDF using the [XDynDocs facilities](https://github.com/duncantl/XDynDocs)
See the (GNUmakefile) in this directory.
